        <h1>Semantic Network Analysis</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Semantic Network Analysis of NetMiner 4.3 enables you to extract words from unstructured text data, such as news, article, SNS and get a word network and visualize it.<br/> 
Also, TF-IDF(Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency, importance of word in a document) and a part of speech can be used for filtering. <br/>
In addition, ‘WordCloud’ can visualize the importance of words using various centrality measures of NetMiner and a topic modeling enables you to identify topics. </li>

        <h1>1.New Python-based Script Workbench and Adaptability of user-generated
        Plug-in</h1>
        <ul>
          <li> NetMiner embed internal Python-based script engine which equipped with the automatic Script Generator for unskilled users. Then the users can operate NetMiner with existing GUI or programmable script language. Also the user-generated script program can be compiled promptly to internal Plug-in to be added to the main menu through few clicks. This means the users can make their own reusable processes or methods, and share them with other users. It is expected that the brand-new Script Workbench will dramatically increase the productivity and efficiency of SNA research.</li>
